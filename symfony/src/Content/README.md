# Content

`Content` domain package contains functionality related to content creation and manupulation.
Content is a general term and an abstraction. Blog and Comment are implementation of this abstraction.
In the future you might create other content types and put them into this domain package and it's respective sub-package (see Blog and Comment packages for clarification).
