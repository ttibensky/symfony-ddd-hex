# UserProfile

`UserProfile` domain package contains functionality related to user profiles.

User profile is in general, owner of a content (blog, comment...). User profile can contain publickly available information about the author of such content, such as name and email. However user profile does not contain any personal information of the person or entity behind the profile. That should go to `User` or `Account` domains.

One user or an account can have multiple user profiles. A user profile can be think of as your personal or company profile on Medium.com. One user can use multiple profiles to publish content and build separate brands.
